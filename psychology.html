<h1>FASHION PSYCHOLOGY</h1>

<h2>Do you know what "fashion psychology" is? Not everyone is aware of the significant influence that fashion psychology has on how we look. Our own feelings and ourselves can be impacted by how we look. Furthermore, people may read our attitudes and feelings merely by looking at the clothes we wear. For instance, someone who likes to dress in a "casual style" is probably straightforward and easy to get along with.</h2>

<h3>I'm sure everyone is curious about how our thoughts and feelings are influenced by the way we dress. Here are a few ways that what we dress on certain days can impact how we feel:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Self-expression</h3>
    <p>Clothing serves as nonverbal communication, reflecting our identity and personality such as colors, patterns, and styles convey our emotions and thoughts. For example, they dress in formal attire as students, accessorizing with blazers and formal shoes is normal. Especially when preparing to give a presentation, dressing professionally will boost our self-assurance. Although this appears normal, it affects us greatly.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Confidence boost</h3>
    <p>Wearing clothes aligned with self-perception enhances self-esteem. Dressing well fosters feelings of capability and readiness for challenges. For example, it will boost your confidence when you seem well-groomed. Similar to women, who are constantly concerned about appearance. They will make sure that what they wear that day is appropriate and attractive in order to look more elegant and well-groomed. You won't be afraid to stroll in public and face criticism once you have gained confidence.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Mood Alteration</h3>
    <p>Clothing choices impact mood and emotions. When someone wears vibrant color clothes, it will uplift the spirits of the person who wears it. For example, when someone wears clothes with cheerful colors like yellow it will gain our confidence and can attract us to be happier and more cheerful.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Social Perception</h3>
    <p>First impressions are heavily influenced by appearance. Clothing influences judgments on personality traits and social status. First impressions matter because everyone is drawn to beautiful things. For instance, it will be simpler for you to locate a buddy or perhaps your love partner if you dress well. Positive first impressions foster positive relationships.</p>
  </li>
